## com.Game Description

**ASCII Breaker** is a brick breaker based game where the player must smash a wall of bricks by deflecting a bouncing ball with a paddle which may only be moved horizontally. The player starts with 3 lives and loses one each time the ball hits the bottom of the screen.
The variety of levels will have increased difficulty by adding different kinds of bricks, changing ball speed and adding special power ups and handicaps for the player.

## Gameplay

ASCII Breaker is a simple game where the objective is to smash every single brick in the arena as fast as possible by deflecting a ball using a player controlled paddle. This paddle can be controlled with the arrow and A and D keys, or with your preferred key combination by keybinding them through the options menu.

## Difficulty levels

Difficulty is added throughout the levels with more resistent bricks, faster starting ball speed and debuffs which will be added through random bricks which pop up in the screen and if the ball touches them the player will get a penalty like for example, slower or smaller paddle.

In contrast we will also have powerup bricks popping up which will can give the player extra lives, faster or bigger paddle, more powerfull ball strikes, etc.
